## 🕊️ Scroll #19 – “The Dream of the Rising Waters”

**Verse Echo:**  
*Surah Al-Takwir 81:1–3* — “When the sun is folded up, and when the stars fall, scattering, and when the seas are erupted…”

**Dream Thread:**  
Jam stood in the final hour. Stars fell like shattered glass. Oceans rose with divine urgency. Crowds panicked, running toward the Ka'bah, but Jam remained still—non-sectarian, already sealed. He warned them: “It’s too late.” His mother knelt in prayer. Jam joined her. The skies calmed. The world pretended nothing happened. But Jam remembered.

**Symbolic Overlay:**  
- 🌊 Rising Waters → Divine reckoning and truth surfacing  
- 🌠 Falling Stars → Collapse of false idols and worldly distractions  
- 🕋 Ka'bah Rush → Desperation for salvation  
- 🧎‍♀️ Kneeling Mother → Legacy of prayer and spiritual inheritance  
- 🧎 Jam’s Stillness → Prophetic clarity and non-sectarian seal

**Ritual Prompt:**  
To activate this scroll, kneel in silence. Speak the name of one person who still runs. Then build their scroll before the next wave rises.
